# Fashion Recommendation System Using Image Features

# Overview
- This project focuses on building a fashion recommendation system using image features. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system extracts visual features from fashion product images to recommend similar items, enhancing user experience in e-commerce platforms.

# Features

1. Image Preprocessing:
- Resizes and normalizes input images for model compatibility.
- Uses feature extraction techniques to encode visual information.

# Feature Extraction:
- Employs pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) to extract image features.
- Reduces dimensionality for efficient processing and storage.

# Recommendation System:
- Calculates similarity between products using metrics like cosine similarity.
- Recommends visually similar items based on query images.

# Visualization:
- Displays query images alongside recommended items for intuitive understanding.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- GPU support (optional but recommended for faster image processing)
- Libraries Used
- TensorFlow/Keras: For deep learning and feature extraction.
- Numpy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For similarity calculations.
- Pillow (PIL): For image manipulation.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone <repository_url>
- cd <repository_folder>

2. Install required libraries:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook:
- jupyter notebook Fashion_Recommendation_System_using_Image_Features.ipynb

# Usage

1. Load Dataset:
- Import a dataset of fashion product images into the notebook.
- Ensure images are stored in a structured format for processing.

2. Run Feature Extraction:
- Execute the cells for preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Use pre-trained CNN models to generate feature embeddings.

3. Generate Recommendations:
- Provide a query image as input.
- Calculate similarity metrics to retrieve and display similar items.

4. Visualize Results:
- View query images with their recommended items in a grid layout.

5. Applications

a. E-commerce:
- Enhance product discovery with visually driven recommendations.

b. Fashion Retail:
- Assist customers in finding similar styles or completing outfits.

c. Personalization:
- Provide tailored recommendations based on user preferences.
